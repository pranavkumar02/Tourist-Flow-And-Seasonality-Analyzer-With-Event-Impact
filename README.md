# Tourist-Flow-And-Seasonality-Analyzer-With-Event-Impact]
# Phase 1 — Problem Understanding & Planning

Define business use-case: Tourism demand forecasting + Event/Festival impact analysis.

Identify stakeholders: tourism boards, hotels, airlines, event organizers.

Gather requirements: Tech stack, budget (per request cost), cloud deployment feasibility.

# Phase 2 — Data Collection & Preparation

# Collect datasets:

Tourism data (visitors, hotel stays, flights).

Event/Festival calendar (local + international).

Weather, economic indicators (optional) for enrichment.

# Preprocess:

Handle missing values, duplicates.

Standardize formats (dates, city names).

Create event-mapping table (city → event dates).

## Phase 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze historical trends (yearly/monthly growth).

Detect seasonal peaks & off-peak months.

Identify event-driven spikes in visitors.

Visualize with line charts, heatmaps, bar plots.

## Phase 4 — Modeling & Forecasting

# Baseline Models:

Time series (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet).

Event/Festival Impact Models:

Difference-in-Differences (DiD).

Regression with Event Dummy Variables.

LLM Integration:

Query-based insights (e.g., “Which event gave the biggest tourism spike in NYC last 5 years?”).

## Phase 5 — Data Pipeline & Cloud Deployment

Build ETL pipeline (raw data → cleaning → storage → model → visualization).

Deploy models & dashboards on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

Cost optimization: per request API usage + caching frequent queries.

## Phase 6 — Visualization & Front-End

Build dashboards (Tableau / Power BI / Streamlit).

Components:

Time series trends (visitors by month).

Event impact spikes (bar chart % increase).

Seasonality heatmap (month vs year).

Forecasts for next 12 months.
