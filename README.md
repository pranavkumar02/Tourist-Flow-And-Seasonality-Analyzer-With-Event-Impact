# Tourist-Flow-And-Seasonality-Analyzer-With-Event-Impact


## _Description:_

The Tourist Flow & Seasonality Analyzer with Event Impact is a data analytics and visualization project developed to analyze and understand tourism trends across the United States. The project explores how visitor flows vary by season, region, and major events, providing valuable insights for tourism boards, travel agencies, hotels, and city planners  make data-backed decisions on staffing, marketing, and promotions.

This dashboard-based project combines data engineering, statistical analysis, and interactive visual storytelling to uncover patterns in tourist behavior and evaluate how festivals or large-scale events influence travel patterns and tourism-based economies.

The system integrates multiple reliable U.S. datasets (TSA, NPS, Hotel Occupancy, Event Calendars) and provides interactive dashboards with real-time hotspot/off-season maps.


## _Objectives:_

To analyze seasonal tourism trends across different U.S. states.

To measure the impact of major events and festivals on tourist inflow.

To identify high and low tourism periods for better decision-making.

To build an interactive dashboard where users can explore patterns through filters such as month, region, destination type, and event category.

To deploy the entire project on a cloud-based environment for easy access and scalability.


## _Key Highlights:_

Developed a fully interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash with modern UI design and dynamic visual components.

Integrated multiple datasets such as TSA checkpoint travel data, National Park Service visits, hotel occupancy rates, and event calendars.

Built a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS, supporting geospatial queries using PostGIS.

Designed and implemented ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to clean, process, and load datasets into the database.

Deployed the final application on AWS, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and reliability.

Provided real-time analytics on visitor volume, YoY growth, and event-based spikes.


## _Project Architecture:_

The system follows a structured multi-layered architecture consisting of:

**Data Layer:** Raw datasets stored in AWS S3 and PostgreSQL (RDS) form the foundation for analysis.

**ETL Layer:** Data cleaning and transformation scripts prepare the data for loading into structured tables using Python and SQL.

**Database Layer:** Tables and materialized views are created in PostgreSQL to optimize query performance and store aggregated metrics.

**Visualization Layer:** Dash-based front-end interface that displays interactive visualizations such as maps, KPIs, heatmaps, and event impact charts.

**Deployment Layer:** The project is hosted on AWS EC2 for accessibility and linked to AWS RDS for real-time data connectivity.


## _Tech Stack:_

Layer	Technology	Description

**Language:**	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) Core scripting.

**Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy	Cleaning, merging, metric computation.

**Visualization:**	Plotly, Dash Bootstrap Components (interactive charts & maps).

**Database:**	PostgreSQL Relational + geospatial queries with PostGIS extension.

**Cloud	AWS:** (RDS, S3)	Hosting, storage, compute.

**Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook

**Infrastructure:** AWS ( S3 for raw data).

**Theme and Styling:** Dash LUX Bootstrap Theme


## _Frontend dashboard (and Fullstack UI):_

The frontend is a Dash app featuring:

**Views Included:** 

**Home Page (Interactive Map):** Choropleth map of U.S. destinations color-coded by lift % (Hotspot, Normal, Off-Season).

**Filters:** Month, region, destination type, event category.

**Seasonality Heatmaps:** High vs. low tourist months.

**Drilldown View:** Destination-specific time series, seasonality heatmap, event impact cards.

 **Event Impact Panel:** Spikes during festivals/events.  
 
**Events Page:** Event list/calendar with links to affected destinations.

 **Event Impact Panel:** Spikes during festivals/events. Last update timestamps, missing data alerts.


## _Backend & Infrastructure:_

**ETL Layer:** Python scripts running as ECS Tasks or Lambda jobs.

**Database:** AWS RDS PostgreSQL (with PostGIS).

**Storage:** AWS S3 buckets for raw, cleaned, and mart data.

**Deployment:** dashboard, GitHub Actions.


## _Business Insights:_

**Peak Tourism Months**: June to August and December.

**Top Performing States:** California, Florida, and Texas maintain consistent tourist inflow.

**Off-Season Trends:** Northern states experience low inflow during winter.

**Event Impacts:** Major festivals significantly boost regional tourism and hotel occupancy.

**YoY Growth:** Post-pandemic recovery evident with increasing domestic travel activity.

These findings support strategic planning for marketing campaigns, event management, and regional tourism development.

**Phase 2	(Week 3):**	Dataset collection, load TSA/NPS data into Postgres.

**Phase 3	(Week 4):**	data cleaning + processing, Backend Process

**Phase 4	(Week 5):**	Integrate event datasets, event impact analytics (EDA + metrics).

**Phase 5	(Week 6):**	Interactive map filters, drilldowns, QA dashboard.

**Phase 6	(Week 7):** working dashboard prototype, 	optimize performance

**Phase 7	(Week 8):**	AWS deployment (EC2 + RDS), Testing, Final demo, final report submission, presentation.


## _How the Project Works:_

**1. Data Collection:** Datasets are sourced from open U.S. tourism and event repositories.

**2. **Data Transformation:**** Python ETL scripts clean, standardize, and merge datasets into a common schema.

**3. Database Integration:** Data is stored and queried through PostgreSQL with optimized indexes and materialized views.

**4. Dashboard Interaction:** The Dash app connects to the database, retrieves aggregated metrics, and updates all visuals dynamically when filters change.

**5. Deployment:** The complete application is deployed to AWS, integrating EC2 for hosting and RDS for database management.


## _How to Run the Project:_

To run the project, users simply:

**1.** Install Python and dependencies (from requirements.txt).

**2.** Set up a PostgreSQL database connection (local or AWS RDS).

**3.** Execute ETL scripts to load data.

**4.** Run the main dashboard file (app.py).

**5.** Open the application in a browser to interact with the dashboard.


## _Business Use Case:_

Tourism boards businesses often lack real-time visibility into seasonality and event-driven demand spikes. This tool empowers decision-makers to:

Allocate staffing during peak months.

Launch promotions in off-season windows.

Benchmark destinations by growth rate.

Justify investments in infrastructure or marketing.

Evaluate event ROI using impact analysis.

Identify fast-growing destinations for future opportunities.

Strategize marketing campaigns around event-driven spikes.
